# FakeFastspell-Freewar
Greasemonkey script for the MMORPG 'http://www.freewar.de/'. It enables the full potential of fastspells when the user is no sponsor,
that is fastspells 5 to 9 and fastspell sets 2 to 5. Further the script allows the user to extend the fastspells by infinitely many.

The available documentation can be found in [our wiki](https://github.com/ZabuzaW/FakeFastspell-Freewar/wiki).
